- [Estimating Switching Costs for Telecommunication Services and Bundles*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00036846.2022.2030046) (with [Hyunchul Kim](https://hyunkimecon.github.io/)), Accepted at Applied Economics, [working paper version](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3787321)

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  We develop a consumer level demand model of telecommunications and broadcasting services taking into account the exhaustive set of alternatives available to consumers, including bundled services. We then estimate the switching costs associated with bundling. Previous studies are confined to choices of only one or two services, rather than addressing inter-relationships among different services made possible through bundling. We find that our approach improves the accuracy of switching cost estimates compared with when the choice sets are restricted in demand models. Our results also indicate that switching costs incurred with bundling are substantial, making up approximately 65% of monthly service costs. </details>

-  Double/Debiased Machine Learning for Static Games with Incomplete Information [early draft](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4377695)

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  This paper presents estimation and inference methods for static games with incomplete information using modern machine learning tools. Conventional econometric methods in Bajari et al. (2010), can only be applied with low-dimensional covariates compared to the sample size N. However, when the data includes high-dimensional covariates, using machine learning estimators to recover the nuisance parameters can lead to biases in the structural parameter of interest, θ0, due to regularization and over-fitting. The proposed estimator addresses these biases by characterizing Neyman orthogonal moments and using cross-fitting algorithm. This allows researchers to use machine learning methods like Lasso, Random Forest, or Neural Networks to estimate the first-stage nuisance parameters, leading to a parameter of interest that is √N-consistent and asymptotically normal. Monte Carlo experiments show that without correction of the moment condition, the nuisance parameters estimated from machine learning estimators can cause significant downward biases (toward zero) in the estimates of θ0. The proposed estimator based on orthogonal moment effectively removes these biases, resulting in estimates that are unbiased and centered on the true value.
